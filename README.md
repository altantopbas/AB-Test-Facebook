# 📊 A/B Testing Analysis

## 🎯 Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced "average bidding" as an alternative to their existing "maximum bidding" method. Our client, bombabomba.com, wants to understand if this new feature brings more conversions than the traditional maximum bidding approach through A/B testing.

## 📌 Project Overview
An interactive educational and analytical platform designed to analyze A/B testing in Facebook advertising strategies. The platform facilitates comparative analysis between maximum bidding and average bidding strategies to evaluate advertising performance.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset includes crucial metrics from a company's website:

Impression: Number of ad views
Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ad
Purchase: Number of products purchased after clicked ads
Earning: Revenue from purchased products

The data is divided into two groups:

Control Group (Maximum Bidding)
Test Group (Average Bidding)
